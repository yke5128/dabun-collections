To Be Happy
2024/10/17

Who told me I would discover something new here?

Who told me I would be free from everything here?

Myself.

The beginning was the fantasy that I created.

Everything I have ever gone through is because of myself.

Seeking happiness itself is painful, sometimes heartbreaking.

However, I, stupidly, was seeking unhappiness, all the while enduring the suffering — I still believe what I really want is solitude?

I wonder — what made me like this?

Always, always, always —

What will answering this with words bring me?

Just thinking alone achieves nothing.

Rather, find it within your suffering.

If you want to be happy, BE.
